# Payroll
Payroll app is designed for the user to enter a rate of pay, total number of  working hours, and when their overtime starts. The app will then return the users Reg time and Overtime. It will also return the users gross earnings.
I have used a masterloop where the user can enter commands including exit. I have used a linq query that pulls from a list. I also impleted a list.
Instructions for use.
Enter your rate of Pay in numerical with out Dollar sign.
Enter numerical hours you worked.
Enter the numerical hours when your overtime begins.
The program will return regular time worked and then overtime worked. It will tell you what your total gross pay will be.
Lastly, you have the option to run it again or exit the program.
