# Payroll
Payroll app is designed for the user to enter a rate of pay, total number of  working hours, and when their overtime starts. The app will then return the users Reg time and Overtime. It will also return the users gross earnings.
I have used a masterloop where the user can enter commands including exit. Also, I have created a class that inherits from its parent. I have used a linq query that pulls from an array.
